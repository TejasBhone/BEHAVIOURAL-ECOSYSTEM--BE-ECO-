# Behavioural Ecosystem (BE-ECO)
### Multi-Framework Behaviour Chaining & Stability Amplification  
© 2025 Tejas Bhone — All Rights Reserved.

The Behavioural Ecosystem (BE-ECO) is a proprietary, ecosystem-scale architecture that enables multiple behavioural frameworks to function in coordinated harmony. BE-ECO amplifies framework stability, extends behavioural lifespan, and creates a controlled “chain effect” where individual systems enhance each other’s consistency.

This is a high-level registration repository intended to document IP ownership.

## 🔧 What BE-ECO Does (High-Level)
- Connects multiple behavioural engines into a unified ecosystem  
- Stabilizes long-run persona behaviour across frameworks  
- Provides cross-framework amplification (each system boosts the others)  
- Reduces drift by ecosystem-level feedback  
- Extends the operational lifespan of agent architectures  
- Allows modular integration of future frameworks

BE-ECO is **not** a persona.  
It is the ecosystem *around* personas, agents, tools, and behavioural engines.

---

## 🧩 Why This Matters
Most behavioural architectures operate in isolation and decay quickly.  
BE-ECO introduces:
- A controlled environment  
- Stability cycles  
- Chained behaviour propagation  
- Layered correction feedback  
- Ecosystem-level resilience  

It is the first documented blueprint enabling chained behavioural consistency in LLM systems.
